Generation of Mesh Block Match Linkset Method
=============================================
Information for each link in this Linkset was taken from PSMA's G-NAF [1] which contains Address -> Meshblock 2011 associations. The specific
method used to generate each link was one of 5 methods described in the G-NAF and represented as a vocabulary of methods here:

* <http://linked.data.gov.au/def/gnaf/code/MeshBlockMatchTypes>

It is one of the 5 methods from that method list which is quoted for each link in the linkset, indicated by the `loci:hadGenerationMethod`, as
per the original data within the G-NAF.


Format conversion of the Linkset
--------------------------------
This Linkset, as an RDF data object outside the G-NAF, was produced using the Mesh Block Match of G-NAF Addresses (Nov, 2018) to ASGS Mesh
Blocks (2011). The Mesh Block Match is part of the G-NAF Nov (2018) dataset [1].


Method
------

1. The G-NAF Nov (2018) dataset was ingested into a PostGreSQL data store.
2. The address_mesh_block_2011 table was dumped to a CSV file.
3. A Python script was used to read in the CSV file and output a new Turtle file as the linkset.
